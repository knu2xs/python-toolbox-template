Python Toolbox Template
=====================

UPDATE 11Feb2014: This repository is now superceded by the https://github.com/knu2xs/arcgis-python-toolbox-bootstrap repository.

This script is not a fully functional working script. Rather, it is the starting point for creating a new ArcGIS Python Toolbox according to the suggestions outlined in my blog posting at:

A discussion and instructions for getting PyScripter set up to author ArcGIS Python Toolboxes can be found at:
